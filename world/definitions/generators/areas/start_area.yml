      in-room-desc: A <key /> is sitting here, deep in thought.
      look-desc: |
          How do you know this being that sits here is a <key />?
          <br />
          You suppose he, or she, or whatever it is would simply ask you,
          \"Well how do we know anything?\", dodging the question in the 
          annoying smart-ass way most philosophers do.
          <br />
          Suffice to say that this being appears contemplative in the face of
          being stuck on a rock floating through an infinite cosmos. If 
          he/she/it weren't a philosopher and it decided to be here anyway,
          perhaps you would start to question it's sanity, or your own.

        You (or the incorporeal manifestation of your self) stands
        (or floats, or exists, or whatever) on the cliffs of a rock surrounded
        on all sides by what looks like a brilliant backdrop of 
        <detail>stars</detail>, <detail>nebulae</detail>, and all sorts of 
        other astronomical things that typically inspire awe in people.
        <br />
        But you are also not exactly people, so you (clearly) have other more
        pressing matters to attend to.

            desc: The plural of nebula. I looked it up, trust me.
