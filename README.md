# Legacy of the Lightkeepers (llk) #

This is an [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/)-based 
[DCC](https://goodman-games.com/store/) MUD (Multi-User Dungeon).

# Setup #

This is the source code for the game, but is mostly just the portion of the
definition that defines the objects and rules for the game itself.

The primary engine of the game is run by Evennia, a Python-based MUD/MUX/MUSH
game engine/system.  It provides the core handling for networking and
authentication, as well as the infrastructure for the game loop, DB-storage 
and basic starting commands.

You can run this source locally by first following the instructions of 
[Evennia Quick Start](https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Getting-Started.html).

Then, you can replace the init-ed shell of a game with this source.
